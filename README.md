# Smart Task Manager with AI Assistance

## 📝 Project Overview

The **Smart Task Manager** lets users easily organize tasks with help from AI-powered subtask suggestions using **Google Gemini**. It features a clean **Next.js** frontend, a secure **Express** backend, and a **PostgreSQL** database hosted on **Supabase**. Users can create, edit, and manage tasks, while AI breaks work into clear subtasks. Secure API routes, responsive design, and smooth deployment make task management smart, simple, and reliable.
